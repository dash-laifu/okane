## Guidelines

### Feature Modules
- Each feature should be self-contained within its own package
- Use the three-layer structure: `ui`, `data`, `domain`
- Features should communicate through shared models and services

### Shared Module
- `models/`: Common data classes used across multiple features
- `utils/`: Helper functions, constants, and utility classes
- `services/`: Background services, notification listeners, system integrations
- `extensions/`: Kotlin extension functions for enhanced functionality

### Future Features
When adding new features, create a new package under `features/` following the same structure:
```
features/
â”œâ”€â”€ [feature_name]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ domain/
```

## Current Status
- âœ… Folder structure created
- âœ… Existing fragments moved to `notificationlog/ui/`
- âœ… Placeholder classes added for demonstration
- ðŸ”„ Ready for feature implementation
